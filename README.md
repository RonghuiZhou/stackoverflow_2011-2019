# stackoverflow_2011-2019

I am going to analyze the data for multi-years, 2011-2019.

Multi-year analysis of stackoverflow: 2011-2019

I am planning to select 5 industries and 5 countries to compare the difference: experience, salary, age, gender, degree
and compare the trend from 2011 to 2019.

### Data source: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey



### Techniques to be used:

#### 1. Visualization:

sns.countplot: http://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.countplot.html


I was originally planning to compare data by year, but they have different column names and it's time consuming to figure out which is which. So I will go with the year 2019.
